<!--
Produce is the parent class, which both Fruit and Vegetable
inherit from.
Both Fruit and Vegetable classes have their own specific 
properties (color for fruits, type for vegetables) 
and methods (isTasty for fruits, isHealthy for vegetables), 
in addition to inheriting the introduce method from the Produce
class.

Instances of Fruit and Vegetable can access both their own methods
and properties, as well as those inherited from the Produce class.
